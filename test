Gitops
Argo CD
Argo CD is not a CI Tool
Push Vs Pull Model --> Argo is Pull based will have controller in it 
Traditional Push based CD on K8s
Limitation and Disadvantages of Above

ArgoCD Where Fits Here?
Git Config repo will tracked 
State Visibility


Argo CD Terms:


Application
-> Source and destination to deploy
	. Source k8s Manif
	. Dest cluster and Namespace details
-> Argo CD supported Application source tools

Projects: Logical grouping of applications
 Enforce RBAC , Allowed resource access fine grain


Desired State vs Actual State
Sync
Refresh and Compare -- Every 3 mins By default


Architecture of Argo CD: SS
	• 3 Core Componets
		○ Argo CD Server Api and web server(Grpc / Rest expose Api web and cli, management operations cluster control and authtications)
		○ Repo server(Internal Server cloning git repo and cloning and creating k8s manifest. What is manifest?)
		○ Application controller( Controller to manage the deployed apps and presync postsync etc na d)
	• Redis used for caching
	• Dex - Identity service responsible for integrating with external ID Providers
	• Application set Controller: It automates and generate the Argo CD Applications Components.

Argo CD:

Installation : (SS)
	• Non Highly available
	• Highly available 
	• Light Instllation without UI
	
Privilages:

	Cluster Admin --> Across Cluter we can use Argo to Deploy
	Namespace Privilages 

YAML Manifest way, Helm Charts or with kustomize


NHA --> Installation --> Getting Password --> By default is not exposed 
	Service : LB to expose Web UI
	Ingress Controller : If we are using ngress Controller
	Port-forward :for access on local machine
	
Argo CD Acccess Methods: CLI, Web UI and API

	USING CLI --> Mange apps repos clusters task etc
	Can be installed to any platform
	Argocd login --> CMD
	Then Further CMD can be used


Applications : It is a K8s resource object representing a deployed applications instance in a env(GITHUB 22 handson )
		--> Source of codes
		--> Destination 
	Declartive way using YAML(Sample with exlanation for each in single file)
	WEB Ui and Cli variurs way to setup app on argo CD

Helm Options on Argo CD:(31 SS, 32 Demo)

	Relaease name , values file, Params, File param, valus as block File
	Directory File options (34 ss abd 35 Demo)

Kustomize(37 SS and 38 Demo)

	Name Prefix ,Suffix ,override ,images ,Common label
	
 Multiple source for applications: Grouping multiple source Helm repo/Git repo(40 SS and )
	Charts with sources tag in Yaml, Custom values from Git and static from Helm
